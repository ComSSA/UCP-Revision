# Details
I made this on my 14 inch M3 macbook pro <3 with clang, so watch out if you're using gcc or some other compiler
run make to compile into object and exec files
nothing is gonna happen when you run the exec because all the c and header files are empty

The borderless flag is a "C flag" not a compiler flag, so it will change how the c files will compile not the makefile setup
