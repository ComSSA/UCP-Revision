# Details
This is not a maths activity!!!
You can try to make a mathematical solution, however we are doing a coding unit
Try to push the students to focus on the programming of the unit rather than getting stuck on the maths.
I compiled this with clang on my 14 inch Macbook M3 pro 8GB ram <3333
I didn't use C89 though because of my inline comments so take out ansi and pedantic flags
gcc -Wall -Werror pizza.c -o pizza
